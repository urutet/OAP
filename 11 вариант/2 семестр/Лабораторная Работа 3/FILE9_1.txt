cElijah! No, Captain Elijah! 
Sorry, youre not a winner 
It starts with one thing 
CI dont know why 
cIt doesnt even matter how hard you try 
CKeep that in mind 
cI designed this rhyme 
CTo explain in due time 
cAll I know 
Time is a valuable thing 
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings 
cWatch it count down to the end of the day 
cThe clock ticks life away 
It's so unreal
